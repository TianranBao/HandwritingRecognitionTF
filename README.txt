# HandwritingRecognitionTF

## Description

I made this project to revisit an old neural network that I made to recognize numbers from the MNIST set. Looking back on the code though, I realized that not only did I not recognize what most of the program actually did, but I also realized that TensorFlow had updated and removed a lot of features. Through making this project, I aim to become familiar with what goes on in a neural net and everything that goes into it as well as solidify my understanding of TensorFlow and the libraries often used with it.

## Installation 

You will have to have the following libraries or software installed for this code to work: 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib 
- Pyplot
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow 
- TensorFlow Datasets
- Python 3.11 

## Usage

[In Progress]

## Credits 

https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/core/mlp_core - Most of the code was bsed off of this guide from the official TensorFlow website. I only changed a few variables to fit my programming style and added a few methods to help me understand and visualize the program better. I also added comments to ensure I really understood the concepts by forcing myself to explain them
